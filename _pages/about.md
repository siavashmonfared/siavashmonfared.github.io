Welcome! I am a theoretical and computational physicist specializing in active matter, biological physics, and the mechanics of complex materials.

My research focuses on understanding how multi-cellular life emerges from single cells through highly orchestrated processes where cells collectively form dynamic patterns without central guidance. I develop theoretical and high-performance computational models to decipher the complex interplay of nonequilibrium statistical physics of living cells with biological functions.

## Research Areas

**Active Matter & Biological Physics**: Understanding collective cellular behavior, cell competition, and multicellular organization through physics-based modeling.

**Granular Materials**: Investigating the mechanics of particulate media with complex shapes and the role of topology in collective behavior.

**Confined Fluids**: Studying capillary phase transitions and fluid behavior in disordered porous media using statistical physics approaches.

**Computational Methods**: Developing multi-phase field models, discrete element methods, and high-performance simulation frameworks for complex systems.

Excited to share our comprehensive review on "Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues" now available on arXiv!

This work provides a unified framework for understanding dense, soft multicellular systems where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the reorganization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers rich physics-based insights into:

- Collective cellular behavior and organization
- Integration of biological physics with experimental data  
- Cell migration in heterogeneous populations
- Confined biological systems

The review covers foundational aspects, applications in active matter physics, and future challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
